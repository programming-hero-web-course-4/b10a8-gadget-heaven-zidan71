3. List of react fundamental concepts:

                                    1. Functional components are used to build reusable UI pieces like Root, ErrorPage, Home, ProductDetails, and Product.

                                    2. useState: Used for managing local state, such as the wishlist state in ProductDetails and filter state in Products.

                                    3. useEffect: Fetches data from data.json in the Products component when the component mounts.

                                    4. react-router-dom for client-side routing

                                    3. Cart & Wishlist: Add products to cart or wishlist, with persistent data and total cost calculation.

                                    4. Dashboard: Switch between Cart and Wishlist views, sort items by price, and manage purchases.

                                    5. Notifications: Real-time feedback with toast messages for user actions like adding items.
